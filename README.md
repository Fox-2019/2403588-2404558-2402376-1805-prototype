# Overview of game

Our Game is inspired by pacman and other similar simple point based games. The goal being to gain as many powerups as you can and gain the highest score. 

# Individual Contributions

Jess - created all the assets/ art and mood boards, Created and wrote the README file in charge of the artistic feel of the project and writing about why we have chosen to code in the manner we have.

Adam - Created the Tilemap mechanics as well as the chunk system. Working heavily on the camera and implementing translate to make the player always visible, implamenting code into the main branch while making sure that it works in a coheasive manner.

Jasveen - Implemented the points system and how the power ups interact with the player class and how many points each powerup should give the player.

Ish - Assisted Jasveen with the points system and provided insight of the inticisies of how to effectivly join together our code in a more efficient manner. responsible for looking at the code as a whole and provide feedback on the direction of the project.

# Themes

The main theme of our game is fantasy, a fantasy world rooted in a providing a relaxing and calming experience for our player. Themes of nature, exploration and feedom, being given full control of where you go on the map allows the player to feel as though they are able to remain in control of what they see and what they dont. As the main artist i specifically chose dark and light contrasting colours to show the vibrance in nature from dark leaking stone to bright flowers that give the feeling of a place long abandoned that they player has the first chance to explore. Giving the player this feeling of exploration in a non stressful enviroment allows for a unique experience similar to the games i took inspiration from.

# Game Design

Our game was designed after older arcade style games that requre the player to gain the highest score they can without the intense pressure of being chased by many different enemies. Similar to games like cookie clicker some games are played simply for the reason of pleasure and aesthetics, somthing i feel we took heavy inspiration from
# Narrative

The narratives elements of our game leave a heavy impact on the player, we understand this. Through the Mechanics of our game we hope to provide an open ended and carefree narrative that allows the player to make of the game what they wish. leaving it open to be interpreted in whatever way the player wishes much like pacman that doesnt follow a set narrative.

# Aesthetic

To provide a fun and nostalgic feeling for our player i took inspiration from the legend of zelda franchise such as majoras mask and ocarina of time,pac man, mario, and princess quest. As the artist i took heavy inspiration from these games as i knew i wanted certain parts such as the powerups to not contrast too heavily with the world around them or any enemies that may be on the screen i specifically chose the objects that i wanted our fairy to collect as well as what possible enemies(should they be implamented ) may look like. While keeping true to that fantastical creature theme that sets the overall narrative for the game. In the process of which i created differing moodboards where you can clearly see what aethetics, colours and forms i took inspiration from all within the genre of pixel based rpg style games.

I chose specific items to create for powerups such as emeralds relating back to legend of zelda and how the currency of the game centers around emeralds linking to how the our main little fairy character was taken from that franchise, i thought it would make the most sense to add these little hints at inspiration but also link together why the fairy has chosen to collect these objects. The second powerup was a little light shard, these where more original and i specifically chose a little star as i wanted the fairy to seem as if it where collecting pieces of light in order to see its way
